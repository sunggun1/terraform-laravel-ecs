This is the terraform laravel redis elasticache ecs ec2 autoscaling rds and blue green codepipeline (codecommit, codebuild, codedeploy)

First, you should have a bash aws installed if you are on windows 10 to execute local-exec.

You make new laravel app with any name in the terraform folder.
You copy app/config/appspec.yml , app/config/buildspec.yml, app/scripts/create-new-task-def.sh into the laravel root folder.

Make new laravel (if you have a composer installed)
docker run --rm -v ${PWD}:/app composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel blog

For local file(in the laravel root folder)
docker run --rm -v ${PWD}:/app composer require laravel/ui
docker run --rm -v ${PWD}:/app npmjs/npm-docker-baseline:12-alpine /bin/bash -c "npm run install; npm run dev"
docker-compose exec app php artisan migrate
docker run --rm -v ${PWD}:/app composer install
docker run --rm -v ${PWD}:/app composer dump-autoload

docker system prune ( to clear all dockers,  if you already have a same volume, you might get an error)
docker build -t docker/nginx -f .\docker\nginx\Dockerfile .
docker build -t docker/laravel -f .\docker\php-fpm\Dockerfile . --progress=plain (to see ls -al)
docker-compose up

You also have to change fargate-service "APP_KEY" value with your app_key on .env
and set your own rds password and username

and .env you change AWS Confidentails with yours.

For terraform (in the terraform folder) 
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply

Delete terraform
terraform delete --auto-approve
(if you have an error to delete , you should manually delete everything else on aws.)

After codepipeline is installed
1. cd laravelfolder
2. git remote add origin ssh://git-codecommit.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/v1/repos/laravel
3. git remote -v (to check the url)
4. git add .
5. git commit -m 'first commit'
6. git push -u origin master


Then the server is all set!

You can access to the web server with the load balancer DNS name after code deploy is finished.
